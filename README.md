# Toxic-Comment-Classification
Project Overview
This project aims to classify toxic comments on online platforms using machine learning models. The dataset, sourced from Wikipedia Talk pages, categorizes comments into different levels of toxicity, including:

Toxic
Severe Toxic
Obscene
Threat
Insult
Identity Hate
By implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and multiple machine learning models, the goal is to moderate toxic comments effectively and foster a safer online environment.
